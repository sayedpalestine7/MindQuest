# Abstract

MindQuest addressed a recognised deficiency in online learning: limited interactivity that reduces student engagement and delays formative feedback. The project developed a full‑stack prototype that integrated authored courses, animated instructional media, inline quizzes, progress synthesis, and role‑based workflows within a single platform. The system combined a React-based frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, employed a relational datastore accessed via Prisma alongside document storage for event data, and used JWT for authentication and a third‑party payment service for gated content.

The implemented artefact demonstrated the feasibility of assembling these components into coherent learning flows and supported the principal engineering objectives: role‑aware enrolment and access control, media‑rich lesson delivery, assessment capture, and derived progress reporting. The outcome is a reproducible engineering prototype and documented design that substantiates a pragmatic approach to integrating interactivity and assessment in an educational platform.
