# Chapter 2: Theoretical Background and Previous Work

## 2.1 Earlier Coursework

Software Engineering:

The Software Engineering course established foundational methodologies for systematic development, including requirements analysis, architectural design, testing, and project management. These principles were applied in MindQuest through explicit requirements specification, modular architecture, iterative development cycles, and an emphasis on automated and manual testing to ensure software quality and maintainability.

Database Systems:

Database Systems coursework contributed essential knowledge of data modelling, relational schema design, indexing, and transaction management. These concepts informed the design of persistent data structures for courses, enrollments, and progress records, and guided decisions regarding consistency, normalization, and performance trade-offs in the implementation.

Web Programming:

Introductory web programming provided practical grounding in client-server interactions, markup, styling, and client-side scripting. The course material underpinned the construction of interactive lesson interfaces and the integration of frontend components with backend endpoints, ensuring a usable and accessible web experience.

Advanced Web Programming:

Advanced topics in web development offered deeper exposure to modern web frameworks, single-page application patterns, state management, and asynchronous communication. These principles were applied to implement component-based interfaces, efficient API consumption, and real-time notification mechanisms within the MindQuest frontend.

Advanced Software Engineering:

Advanced Software Engineering coursework expanded upon foundational development practices by emphasizing scalable system design, design patterns, software architecture styles, and maintainability in large-scale applications. These concepts influenced MindQuest through the adoption of layered architecture, clear separation of concerns, and the use of reusable components and service abstractions. Attention to code quality, refactoring, and documentation supported long-term maintainability, while exposure to agile and iterative development practices informed the project’s incremental implementation and continuous improvement process.
